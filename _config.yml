 ‘Lander’ is one of many Landing Page demos included in the Rife Free WordPress Theme. The free version features AJAX loading portfolio items, video backgrounds, intro typewriter effect text, a sticky header that smooth scrolls to sections, testimonials, pricing table, team, a contact form and WooCommerce + Elementor support. One of the better free WordPress themes I’ve seen in the past couple years!
